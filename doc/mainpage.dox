  @section introduction Introduction

  The project aims at implementing a nearest neighbors algorithm.
  The problem is the following: given a set of point \f$S\f$ in \f$R^d\f$ and an input point \f$p\f$
  return the closest point from \f$p\f$ in \f$S\f$. I choose to use KD-trees to answer this problem.
